# Emotion for Emacs

A way to jump to specific characters in the currently visible area of a
buffer similar to Vim's [EasyMotion](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3526) plugin.

After installing and requiring it, bind `emotion-jump` to a key. To
use it, press your chosen key and type to character you want to jump
to. All the characters that match the one that was typed will be
highlighted with a letter so that you can type which one you want.
