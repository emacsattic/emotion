# Emotion for Emacs

Emotion is a movement plugin, addon, package for Emacs that lets you
move to a specific character in the currently visible area similar to
Vim's [EasyMotion](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3526) plugin.

After installing and requiring it, bind `emotion-jump` to a key. When
editing a text file press the key and enter a character to search
for. Overlays will appear over each matching character showing which
key you can press to jump to that specific character.
